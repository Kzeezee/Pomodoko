# Pomodoko
Pomodoko is your typical Pomodoro counter application with a task system built-in. It is a cross-platform application (Windows, Mac, Linux) and is built using Tauri and Svelte. The project was started as a way to experiment and develop something light in Tauri to get used to cross-platform app development with web frameworks on the frontend.

# Features
The full list of features include:
- Pomodoro counter (Pomodoro, Short Rest, Long Rest)
- Settings to customize preferred duration for the above 3 states using Svelte Stores
- Task system to allow you to keep track of tasks for the session
- Tasks are dynamically saved on the local SQLite database for persistence
- Notification alerts when there is a change of state (e.g. from Pomodoro to rest)
- Autostart application on boot to get right back to work
